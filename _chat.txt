[11/07/22, 19:05:27] Rohan: No marriage for you
[11/07/22, 19:05:29] Nishant: Check and lmk
[11/07/22, 19:05:50] Rohan: My flight should have boarded 49 mins ago😭
[11/07/22, 19:09:38] Uttara: I have an extra ncuc cap @918571977271 want me to leave for u?
[11/07/22, 19:10:18] Rishy: Yes the band is there in my bag
[11/07/22, 19:10:29] Dhruva Panyam: Woah yeah that'd be great
[11/07/22, 19:10:39] Dhruva Panyam: Maybe some other blr peep also is missing one
[11/07/22, 19:10:41] Dhruva Panyam: can give them

[11/07/22, 19:12:22] Rishy: ‎Rishy changed the subject to “Panchus”
[11/07/22, 19:14:17] Kavya Satish: im so glad i could contribute to panchu culture in this way 🥰
[11/07/22, 19:14:57] Rohan: We should add Sasi here
[11/07/22, 19:15:13] Rishy: Who dat
[11/07/22, 19:15:24] Nishant: Lol
[11/07/22, 19:16:53] Kavya Satish: +1
[11/07/22, 19:17:25] Rishy: Meanwhile Panchus, please start thinking about a frisbee team name for NLS / NLSIU / National Law School — I have initiated the process within 24 hours of the thought. 

I want to try my best to field a team from NLS in next year’s NCUC. I’ve found a partner for this project at NLS as well.
[11/07/22, 19:17:40] Rohan: Sasukumar Panchu he plays frisbee
[11/07/22, 19:17:49] Rohan: Hey man that's not fair
[11/07/22, 19:17:51] Dhruva Panyam: You're welcome
[11/07/22, 19:18:00] Rishy: Why bro
[11/07/22, 19:18:06] Rohan: I can't compete against you😭😭
[11/07/22, 19:18:12] Rohan: You'll rek me 😭😭
[11/07/22, 19:18:30] Rishy: Now think about a fun punny law or NLS related and frisbee term related name
[11/07/22, 19:18:49] Nishant: No scene
[11/07/22, 19:18:51] Rohan: You'll tell your team don't let him go deep ge can only do that then they'll block my deepd and I'll be irrelevant
[11/07/22, 19:18:54] Nishant: Hammerheads supremacy
[11/07/22, 19:19:04] Kavya Satish: rishy traitor omg
[11/07/22, 19:19:08] Rishy: You’ll have hammerheads with you sir 🙏🏻

Even if i can find some people to play it’ll be like Fellows vibe
[11/07/22, 19:19:40] Rishy: By next year you’ll be state level player so you’ll double trick me by doing everything 😎
[11/07/22, 19:20:04] Rishy: This
[11/07/22, 19:20:08] Rishy: How
[11/07/22, 19:20:20] Nishant: Grower*
[11/07/22, 19:20:38] Rishy: I wanna play another NCUC 
Next year will be like HH in the top 8 pool and NLS in the bottom 8 vibes
[11/07/22, 19:20:45] Rishy: And we can support each other
[11/07/22, 19:20:49] Rohan: Actually I'm excited man
[11/07/22, 19:20:51] Rishy: _IF IT HAPPENS_
[11/07/22, 19:20:57] Rishy: First of all this is day 0
[11/07/22, 19:21:01] Rishy: Of me having a thought
[11/07/22, 19:21:02] Rohan: I want all of you also to do it when you go for masters
[11/07/22, 19:21:05] Rishy: And taking a small action
[11/07/22, 19:21:07] Rishy: Who knows
[11/07/22, 19:21:08] Rohan: We'll make it happen
[11/07/22, 19:21:25] Rohan: You and me
[11/07/22, 19:21:26] Kavya Satish: so cute this thought is
[11/07/22, 19:21:32] Rishy: It’s law school bro. Kashta scenes. And like 6-8 months to go
[11/07/22, 19:21:44] Kavya Satish: brb googling "law buzzwords" rn
[11/07/22, 19:21:52] Rishy: Love it
[11/07/22, 19:22:14] Rohan: Just select some 20 random people and come like MTB with 5 exceptional players
[11/07/22, 19:22:20] Rohan: You'll win
[11/07/22, 19:23:12] Kavya Satish: also why is there no team called dump truck
[11/07/22, 19:23:24] Rishy: Okay so to incentivise people — if your suggested name eventually gets used for the team name and NLS actually plays NCUC (read the conditions clearly again), I will gift you some ultimate paraphernalia
‎[11/07/22, 19:23:49] Rohan:  ‎image omitted
[11/07/22, 19:24:00] Rishy: There aren’t any ready made products. We’ll need to prepare
[11/07/22, 19:24:35] Rishy: There is actually, in the US
[11/07/22, 19:25:02] Kavya Satish: counter offer, if the team gets made at all with the team name - you must gift
[11/07/22, 19:25:15] Kavya Satish: because playing ncuc there are too many variables
[11/07/22, 19:26:09] Rishy: But technically team won’t be ‘made’ until you compete somewhere. We won’t have a jersey. We won’t have any official presence to be called a team. 

Right now I know there are some 5-10 people who throw and play sometimes.
[11/07/22, 19:26:15] Rishy: So that’s already there
[11/07/22, 19:26:32] Kavya Satish: if a whatsapp group is made
[11/07/22, 19:26:37] Kavya Satish: with more than 20 people
[11/07/22, 19:26:47] Kavya Satish: actually between 15-20 people
[11/07/22, 19:26:51] Kavya Satish: who play often enough
[11/07/22, 19:26:57] Kavya Satish: its made
[11/07/22, 19:27:05] Rishy: It could be 20 people who want to throw or are interested in frisbee. Like the Ashoka Ultimate group had 200+
[11/07/22, 19:27:09] Rishy: Vague
[11/07/22, 19:27:23] Kavya Satish: ur ass is vague bro chup
[11/07/22, 19:27:27] Rishy: Playing NCUC part is non-negotiable
[11/07/22, 19:27:31] Rishy: You can negotiate the gift maybe
[11/07/22, 19:27:42] Kavya Satish: what are options
[11/07/22, 19:28:28] Rishy: You can create
[11/07/22, 19:29:57] Rishy: Airbenchers could actually be appropriate here 
@918571977271 😂

[11/07/22, 19:30:28] Dhruva Panyam: Nice one man
[11/07/22, 19:30:29] Rishy: Discustody
[11/07/22, 19:30:54] Rishy: Why is Discovery not a team name
[11/07/22, 19:31:02] Dhruva Panyam: Gavel Call
[11/07/22, 19:32:25] Rishy: Hmm
[11/07/22, 19:32:30] Rishy: Not catchy
[11/07/22, 19:33:05] Rishy: High Count
[11/07/22, 19:33:08] Rishy: Bad lol
[11/07/22, 19:33:19] Dhruva Panyam: It's the journey that matters
[11/07/22, 19:33:57] Rishy: Jurisdisction
[11/07/22, 19:34:05] Nishant: Discourt deewane
[11/07/22, 19:34:13] Dhruva Panyam: 😂

[11/07/22, 19:36:28] Dhruva Panyam: Yes xP
The team can be referred to as Your Honour
[11/07/22, 19:36:29] Rohan: Recess breakers
[11/07/22, 19:36:38] Rishy: Insaaane 😂
[11/07/22, 19:36:40] Dhruva Panyam: Nicee
[11/07/22, 19:36:46] Dhruva Panyam: I was thinking Hang Time Jury
[11/07/22, 19:36:56] Rohan: I like this
[11/07/22, 19:37:06] Kavya Satish: Huck-say
[11/07/22, 19:37:11] Rishy: Your Honour is the quirkiest so far

[11/07/22, 19:39:38] Dhruva Panyam: DoD
[11/07/22, 19:39:47] Rishy: Lol
[11/07/22, 19:39:50] Rishy: That’s not really copying
[11/07/22, 19:40:09] Kavya Satish: con-disc-tion
[11/07/22, 19:40:18] Kavya Satish: like conviction

[11/07/22, 19:46:56] Nishant: 🤣🤣
[11/07/22, 19:47:30] Rishy: I’m now thinking of other factors — cheer potential, unmistaken pronounciation even for not English proficient people, just thinking
[11/07/22, 19:47:41] Rishy: How would you say this
[11/07/22, 19:47:49] Nishant: Judiciary
[11/07/22, 19:47:54] Nishant: Normally only
[11/07/22, 19:47:58] Dhruva Panyam: Judisiary

[11/07/22, 19:48:38] Rishy: Yeah but here it’s “disc” anyway 
But in judiciary it’s “dish”
[11/07/22, 19:48:45] Rishy: It’s not the same
[11/07/22, 19:49:03] Dhruva Panyam: Ju-dishy-ary

[12/07/22, 12:30:44] Rishy: It’s not
[12/07/22, 12:30:53] Rishy: You told me also, in the moment I left it to not complicate

[12/07/22, 13:11:41] Rohan: I really agree
[12/07/22, 13:11:54] Rohan: One of the few
[12/07/22, 13:12:29] Rohan: Nishant also
[12/07/22, 13:12:34] Rohan: Beautiful to see
[12/07/22, 13:14:58] Hari: bro 😂😂😂
[12/07/22, 13:15:03] Hari: "the other team"
[12/07/22, 13:15:23] Rohan: Brother all that matters is you achieved your goal
[12/07/22, 13:17:25] Dhruva Panyam: Uttara was safest handler
[12/07/22, 13:27:44] Dhrthi Cool: +1
[12/07/22, 13:28:30] Dhrthi Cool: Same
[12/07/22, 13:28:35] Dhruva Panyam: Hari with the 0.23 D's per point
[12/07/22, 13:28:38] Dhruva Panyam: Mad fellow
[12/07/22, 13:29:07] Dhrthi Cool: Bro man's actually maf
[12/07/22, 13:29:08] Dhrthi Cool: Mad
[12/07/22, 13:30:12] Rohan: My per point stats this tournament we're too on the bottom side it's just overall shit😭
[12/07/22, 13:30:21] Rishy: Insane lad
[12/07/22, 13:30:27] Rishy: Shuttit 😂
[12/07/22, 13:30:53] Rohan: Hari on D apart from the first game was the best I've seen him play on D in ages
[12/07/22, 13:31:15] Rohan: No I'm saying overall is decent but per points I'm below the team average
[12/07/22, 13:33:25] Dhruva Panyam: Rishy's O efficiency top notch
[12/07/22, 14:23:32] Rishy: Thanks man
[12/07/22, 14:24:04] Rishy: But I think O efficiency is the one parameter that's far from accurate because Rushil hasn't recorded a majority of the non-consequential passes
[12/07/22, 14:24:14] Rishy: What did you base this on?
[12/07/22, 14:25:06] Dhruva Panyam: Ya correct I didn't know what Rushil did lol
[12/07/22, 14:25:21] Dhruva Panyam: He didn't count most of the handler completions
[12/07/22, 14:25:44] Dhruva Panyam: Based on passing percentage you both were around 70 I think
[12/07/22, 14:27:03] Dhruva Panyam: Wait no
O efficiency is accurate
[12/07/22, 14:27:26] Rishy: O
[12/07/22, 14:27:28] Rishy: Sorry
[12/07/22, 14:27:29] Rishy: Lol
[12/07/22, 14:27:31] Dhruva Panyam: Passing percentage won't be
[12/07/22, 14:27:42] Dhruva Panyam: Cuz it depends on outcome of the point
[12/07/22, 14:27:48] Rishy: That's what I meant
[12/07/22, 14:29:15] Dhruva Panyam: Cuz there's no way pj had just 2 completions
[12/07/22, 14:29:24] Dhruva Panyam: The baller that she was
[12/07/22, 14:29:32] Rishy: Exactly
[12/07/22, 14:29:57] Dhruva Panyam: PJ would have OP zone wing efficiency if that was a thing
[12/07/22, 14:30:12] Dhrthi Cool: Fr
[12/07/22, 14:30:42] Dhrthi Cool: Watching from the sideline i was sooo impressed

[12/07/22, 20:59:47] Rishy: Hey no. For this you need to be enrolled as a student in _some_ college 

And then you could be working/interning in some other and play for them. 

You can’t be anybody doing some job but interning at a university, that would make you admin. Rules say you need to be a full-time student somewhere.
[12/07/22, 21:05:36] Rohan: See this you can get

[12/07/22, 21:06:25] Rohan: And get bonafides attesting to that and have ID cards

[13/07/22, 20:38:59] Rohan: He has 2 years atleast 1
[13/07/22, 20:39:15] Rishy: I find that hard to believe man

[13/07/22, 20:39:27] Rishy: They would’ve finished 2022
[13/07/22, 20:39:34] Rishy: No more alumni
[13/07/22, 20:40:01] Rohan: That's why i like our move to play current students this year
[13/07/22, 20:40:07] Rohan: Instead of predominantly alums

[13/07/22, 20:42:18] Rohan: Was going to be implemented this year itself
[13/07/22, 20:42:36] Rohan: Because regionals can defo happen atleast south

[14/07/22, 14:49:54] Rishy: No man, it’s not called spoilers
[14/07/22, 14:49:58] Rohan: In the US Super Bowl are considered spoilers
[14/07/22, 14:49:59] Dhrthi Cool: Then what brother
[14/07/22, 14:50:02] Dhruva Panyam: You only called it spoiler bch
[14/07/22, 14:50:07] Rohan: They are called spoilers
[14/07/22, 14:50:21] Rishy: Because were treating it like a show
[14/07/22, 14:50:25] Rohan: Atleast for the global sports
[14/07/22, 14:50:35] Nishant: +
[14/07/22, 14:50:38] Nishant: But +
[14/07/22, 14:50:39] Rohan: Cricket, tennis and all not called spoilers

[14/07/22, 14:51:26] Dhruva Panyam: F1 cars have spoilers
[14/07/22, 14:51:37] Rishy: It’s not something to be ‘guarded’ and the climax to be kept ‘secret’ by their very nature
[14/07/22, 14:51:49] Rishy: We have a winner
[14/07/22, 14:52:28] Nishant: Sidenote, i just decided to go to some random Andhra mess i found on the road for lunch

[14/07/22, 14:52:51] Nishant: I payed 90, and I'm so full
[14/07/22, 14:52:54] Dhruva Panyam: We're just generous man
[14/07/22, 14:52:58] Nishant: And people eat like thrice the amount of rice
[14/07/22, 14:53:01] Nishant: It's just crazy
[14/07/22, 14:53:12] Nishant: Both how it's that cheap and how people eat that much rice in one go
[14/07/22, 14:53:46] Rishy: I’m in a weird mood today so *paid
[14/07/22, 14:53:52] Rohan: Actually they can because they're not intrinsically live to everyone watching, there's a 30 - 40 second lag between event and its arrival to commentary in the production to filter verbal content publically, and sports broadcasters have to sign NDAs atleast in the Europe and US to ensure they don't reveal what's happened on social media in those 30-45 seconds
[14/07/22, 14:54:04] Nishant: Dudw thanks

(Like undercover except there's only one person who doesn't have any details)

10. Scattergories https://scattergoriesonline.net/ 
(Like name place animal thiing except the categories changes every round and each person has 60 seconds to enter something under each category for a given letter)

11. Fish bowl https://fishbowl-game.com/ 
Charades+Taboo+Codenames - everyone writes down a few phrases or terms, and then the group is split into two teams. 3 rounds. Round 1, players must use words to describe the word or phrase on the card. In round 2, players must act out or use gestures to describe the word or phrase. In round 3, players can only use one word to describe the word or phrase.

12. Mutter Nonsense www.mutternonsense.us
(only 3-12 players, like cards against humanity+psych, there are fill in the blanks and you have to enter your answer, not offensive i think)

13. Kahoot
(personalized quiz)

14. Cards against humanity

[15/07/22, 09:32:53] Nishant: Some message might not have been that funny
[15/07/22, 09:32:56] Nishant: But if someone reacts
[15/07/22, 09:32:59] Nishant: I also do
[15/07/22, 09:33:10] Hari: they should just let us react with the entire range of emojis

[15/07/22, 09:43:57] Nishant: Gopals
[15/07/22, 09:57:55] Rishy: another long long overdue feature was to see just unread chats
[15/07/22, 09:57:59] Rishy: and that filter is there
[15/07/22, 09:58:08] Rishy: makes my life so much better
[15/07/22, 09:58:16] Kavya Satish: wait wdym
[15/07/22, 09:58:25] Kavya Satish: are u srs???
[15/07/22, 09:58:37] Kavya Satish: DUUUUDE THANK FUUUUCK
[15/07/22, 09:58:52] Kavya Satish: i keep archiving >.<
[15/07/22, 09:59:12] Rishy: how is this related to being able to see unread chats separately
[15/07/22, 09:59:24] Kavya Satish: i archive read chats
[15/07/22, 09:59:30] Rishy: OHHH
[15/07/22, 09:59:31] Kavya Satish: the minute i read them
[15/07/22, 09:59:32] Rishy: shit
[15/07/22, 09:59:34] Rishy: that's hard work
[15/07/22, 09:59:43] Kavya Satish: its meditative
[15/07/22, 10:00:12] Rishy: I would've done that but I need archived chats and not have them pop back up to silence many groups
[15/07/22, 10:00:25] Rishy: so I just pursue having 0 undread messages instead
[15/07/22, 10:00:34] Rohan: Same man
[15/07/22, 10:00:49] Rishy: and that's the problem, when you fall behind, you're dead
[15/07/22, 10:00:50] Kavya Satish: thats just impossible, what if u forget to reply
[15/07/22, 10:00:53] Rishy: it'll take 3-4 days to recover
[15/07/22, 10:00:58] Kavya Satish: or give bad reply
[15/07/22, 10:00:58] Rishy: mark as unread
[15/07/22, 10:00:59] Rishy: or reply
[15/07/22, 10:01:05] Rishy: i don't

[15/07/22, 10:01:16] Rishy: i was there
[15/07/22, 10:01:18] Rishy: once I put effort
[15/07/22, 10:01:19] Kavya Satish: icarus
[15/07/22, 10:01:23] Rishy: now I'm at 0
[15/07/22, 10:01:25] Kavya Satish: jesus fuck
[15/07/22, 10:01:29] Rishy: and it's been hard work but rewarding
[15/07/22, 10:01:37] Rishy: and having 2 separate phones and whatsapps also helps
[15/07/22, 10:01:50] Kavya Satish: i think this is a cheat code
[15/07/22, 10:02:00] Rishy: could be
[15/07/22, 10:02:40] Rohan: That's why i always tell people that even if it takes a while the fact i respond to you at some point means i really care about you
[15/07/22, 10:02:41] Kavya Satish: because there was a time where i only used whatsapp for work and did all the chilling on messenger
[15/07/22, 10:02:46] Kavya Satish: and it was very ez
[15/07/22, 10:02:53] Rohan: Wink wink
[15/07/22, 10:03:05] Kavya Satish: 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
[15/07/22, 10:03:14] Kavya Satish: what is wink wink abt this
[15/07/22, 10:03:25] Rohan: Chilling on messenger
[15/07/22, 10:03:31] Rohan: A picture sending app
[15/07/22, 10:03:35] Rohan: Like Facebook
[15/07/22, 10:05:01] Kavya Satish: rohan that reaction would be warranted if i had sad snapchat
[15/07/22, 10:05:29] Uttara: i would simply pass away

[15/07/22, 10:14:25] Nishant: That's why I didn't make the direct final tryout list
[15/07/22, 10:14:48] Nishant: Kishore Dubai is also my quad coach. While talking today he said you ask selectors and see
[15/07/22, 10:14:59] Nishant: So we'll see

[15/07/22, 10:17:59] Uttara: but what makes me feel great is that both of you, dhrthi and nish, almost always reply to me
[15/07/22, 10:18:01] Uttara: so i feel nice
[15/07/22, 10:18:13] Rishy: I'm not.. because most times when I open after class or something it'll be like that
[15/07/22, 10:18:22] Rishy: And then i sit and focus and bring it to 0
[15/07/22, 10:18:51] Uttara: big man big man

"That's why i always tell people that even if it takes a while the fact i respond to you at some point means i really care about you"
[15/07/22, 10:19:06] Rishy: scam

[15/07/22, 10:20:06] Rishy: Not worth straining for a certain unfavourable result
[15/07/22, 10:20:09] Rishy: Saving for Sakkath
[15/07/22, 10:20:20] Rishy: That'll be intense, not chill like NCUC so I can't be doing jugaad
[15/07/22, 10:20:33] Nishant: Hmmm right

[16/07/22, 14:49:30] Rohan: There he has my sishya good faith backing him
[16/07/22, 14:49:57] Rohan: But this is too culture shock indirectly my two worlds school and college world's colliding
[16/07/22, 14:52:30] Hari: so 2nd SF is better than 1st SF?

[16/07/22, 15:02:49] Hari: would you*
[16/07/22, 15:05:50] Rishy: No
[16/07/22, 15:05:52] Rishy: I wouldn’t
[16/07/22, 15:08:00] Hari: this is the 1st full game i have watched and felt i couldn't have played in this game
[16/07/22, 15:08:30] Rishy: Bro the quality of ultimate is just too bloody high
[16/07/22, 15:08:33] Rishy: Highest of the highest

[16/07/22, 15:09:45] Hari: also Alabama power is so 🤭🤭🤭
[16/07/22, 15:11:16] Rishy: It’s like: 
The only way you dump is by losing yardage. 
The only way you get a D is by a layout. 
Every reset cut is also a 100% cut. 
You can throw factoring in the layout reach because it’s a given. And sometimes you need to.
[16/07/22, 15:14:53] Rishy: OH MY GOD
[16/07/22, 15:15:10] Rishy: FKN HELL

[16/07/22, 15:33:44] Rishy: I was watching some of the other sports in The World Games and thinking, "what stupid shit is this" but then, is that how others also think when they see ultimate? :P
[16/07/22, 15:34:12] Rishy: Lacrosse and Floorball -.-
[16/07/22, 15:36:51] Dhrthi Cool: Not real sports psh

[16/07/22, 15:37:22] Rishy: Even beach handball looks so lame
[16/07/22, 15:37:36] Hari: bruh
[16/07/22, 15:38:13] Rishy: What
[16/07/22, 15:39:18] Rishy: Okay slomo goals are looking lit
[16/07/22, 15:39:41] Rishy: But the game is looking very limited
[16/07/22, 15:39:51] Rishy: Only 1 or 2 things you can do
[16/07/22, 15:50:00] Hari: bro even handball has different kinds of throws
[16/07/22, 15:50:10] Hari: I'd say v similar to ultimate
[16/07/22, 15:55:12] Rishy: No man, I’d like to disagree
[16/07/22, 15:55:36] Rishy: You can just listen to the commentary.. there’s no variation, no difference
[16/07/22, 16:01:52] Kavya Satish: bro
[16/07/22, 16:01:54] Kavya Satish: come on
[16/07/22, 16:02:20] Rishy: What guys
[16/07/22, 16:02:27] Rishy: It’s not beach volleyball I’m talking about
[16/07/22, 16:02:30] Rishy: Beach handball
[16/07/22, 16:02:43] Kavya Satish: i know but beach sports are ALWAYS so fun to watch
[16/07/22, 16:03:17] Rishy: Um. Okay fine consider my comments for just handball. Doesn’t change anything
[16/07/22, 16:04:00] Kavya Satish: where's your spine rishy stand your ground 😤😤
[16/07/22, 16:07:43] Rishy: I’m standing my ground and my ground is handball is lame

[16/07/22, 17:32:52] Kavya Satish: inspiration bro
[16/07/22, 17:33:22] Dhruva Panyam: I could never lol
[16/07/22, 17:33:55] Rishy: I could
[16/07/22, 17:33:58] Rishy: But just not on D
[16/07/22, 17:34:04] Rishy: Nishant needs to teach me man
[16/07/22, 17:34:05] Rishy: Seriously
[16/07/22, 17:35:03] Nishant: Lol
[16/07/22, 17:35:10] Nishant: No scene man
[16/07/22, 17:35:14] Dhruva Panyam: How was tryouts mf
[16/07/22, 17:35:27] Nishant: Lots of thoughts
[16/07/22, 17:35:37] Dhruva Panyam: Send vn whenever
[16/07/22, 17:35:40] Nishant: Draining man
[16/07/22, 17:35:47] Nishant: It's just hard
[16/07/22, 17:35:58] Nishant: It's such a mindset thing for these tryouts
[16/07/22, 17:36:31] Nishant: Especially for someone like me who doesn't already have visibility in the TN club scene as compared to other big names
[16/07/22, 17:36:40] Nishant: So it just takes soo much more mental effort to just be seen
[16/07/22, 17:36:44] Nishant: And get opportunity
[16/07/22, 17:36:50] Nishant: Tryouts is just games
[16/07/22, 17:37:02] Nishant: This energy i just don't have today
[16/07/22, 17:37:11] Nishant: I just want to be played and I'll play well
[16/07/22, 17:37:18] Nishant: But that's not even close to enough you get me
[16/07/22, 17:37:24] Dhruva Panyam: Hmm :/ I get what you mean
[16/07/22, 17:37:36] Dhruva Panyam: Can't possibly show how you play in a few hours
[16/07/22, 17:37:44] Dhruva Panyam: Next to people who are known
[16/07/22, 17:37:49] Nishant: Im not even convinced that I'll be seen if i play because it's 3 selectors and 75 people
[16/07/22, 17:37:56] Nishant: I have to be extraordinary
[16/07/22, 17:38:09] Nishant: And this will always weigh on my mind. Whether I'm being seen
[16/07/22, 17:38:15] Nishant: Regardless of how little expectations i have
[16/07/22, 17:38:30] Nishant: I'll want to do well, but yeah it takes not just skill but energy
[16/07/22, 17:38:37] Kavya Satish: that's so messed up :/ sorry man nishu that sounds really tough
[16/07/22, 17:38:41] Nishant: Yup, there's no way around
[16/07/22, 17:38:53] Nishant: Have to only be consistent and gain visibility over time
[16/07/22, 17:39:03] Dhruva Panyam: Yeah guess that's how the system works
[16/07/22, 17:39:05] Nishant: It's not unfair though man, there's really not other way
[16/07/22, 17:39:09] Dhruva Panyam: Can't really blame it though
[16/07/22, 17:39:12] Dhruva Panyam: Yeah
[16/07/22, 17:39:15] Kavya Satish: no but isn't there
[16/07/22, 17:39:20] Nishant: I knew only. I thought I'll just have fun because i really have no expectations
[16/07/22, 17:39:27] Kavya Satish: a longer season for recruitment
[16/07/22, 17:39:29] Nishant: But it's annoying because i dont have energy
[16/07/22, 17:39:36] Dhruva Panyam: Over time a lot more trust they'll have based on your playing experience
[16/07/22, 17:39:39] Nishant: And body also giving
[16/07/22, 17:39:49] Nishant: Some quad is fucked, i can't run without thinii
[16/07/22, 17:39:53] Nishant: Yeah correct
[16/07/22, 17:40:07] Kavya Satish: that's the norm right? you have about a month or so where recruiment is actively a target?
[16/07/22, 17:40:55] Dhruva Panyam: But this is state team and idk how big that scene is yet
[16/07/22, 17:41:10] Kavya Satish: oh sheist
[16/07/22, 17:41:34] Dhruva Panyam: There was some tournament with state teams that got cancelled no? Around lockdown time?
[16/07/22, 17:41:43] Dhruva Panyam: @919945885330 was this the one we wanted to watch?
[16/07/22, 17:41:55] Nishant: He's
[16/07/22, 17:41:57] Nishant: Yes*

[16/07/22, 17:42:15] Nishant: One week before NCUC
[16/07/22, 17:42:44] Dhruva Panyam: Okay regardless, how did you thinj you played da?
[16/07/22, 17:42:47] Dhruva Panyam: What did you do?

[17/07/22, 18:43:42] Rohan: Cocky bch

[17/07/22, 18:57:28] Rohan: In general he's been assholey towards me
[17/07/22, 18:57:37] Rohan: Played on a team with him once also
[17/07/22, 19:00:15] Uttara: Oh no
[17/07/22, 19:03:59] Rishy: I won’t be able to watch today so I checked off score of bronze game @918571977271 @919840427103
[17/07/22, 19:04:34] Rishy: Unfortunately
[17/07/22, 19:04:46] Rishy: I watched some clips of our MTB game and it was just disgusting
[17/07/22, 19:04:46] Nishant: That's ok bro
[17/07/22, 19:04:54] Rishy: After watching world games
[17/07/22, 19:05:00] Rishy: Such a bad idea
[17/07/22, 19:05:05] Rishy: Hari was smart, watched before
[17/07/22, 19:05:14] Nishant: 😂😂😂

[17/07/22, 19:05:33] Nishant: It's like watching SGR footage and then training camp videos
[17/07/22, 19:05:35] Rishy: It was so depressing man not gonna lie
[17/07/22, 19:05:46] Nishant: But higher contrast
[17/07/22, 19:05:48] Rishy: It’s half the reason I didn’t feel like watching more ultimate today
[17/07/22, 19:07:42] Kavya Satish: take it as motivation bro
[17/07/22, 19:09:12] Rishy: Motivation for what? It was an eye sore I’m saying that’s all :P
[17/07/22, 19:14:45] Nishant: This world Games content really was peak ultimate for me also
[17/07/22, 19:15:02] Nishant: I think the quality of coverage and commentary and all also contributed
[17/07/22, 19:15:10] Nishant: Apart from quality of the ultimate itself
[17/07/22, 19:16:15] Hari: bro 2nd SF is better than 1st
[17/07/22, 19:33:58] Kavya Satish: to not be an eyesore lmao

[19/07/22, 19:33:00] Rohan: The Rajalis squad that they're building into a club team is actually mad
[19/07/22, 19:33:55] Hari: bro but how will it work
[19/07/22, 19:34:01] Hari: is rama seriously gonna ditch flywild

[19/07/22, 20:03:09] Dhrthi Cool: ‎This message was deleted.
[19/07/22, 20:03:19] Rishy: People realise that your historic clubs based on proximity will not help you field the most competitive squad.
[19/07/22, 20:03:31] Rishy: Ambush did that. High tide did that. Now Rajalis is my guess.
[19/07/22, 20:03:53] Rishy: You build a squad specifically to train to compete and worlds so you bring people who are willing to commit money and training and all that.
[19/07/22, 20:04:41] Rishy: My gut is Bangalore is gonna follow next, some TIKS/Airbenders guys also have been talking about breaking away a bit and making an OP Bangalore based squad of youngsters (not masters level) who can compete at WUCC in 3 years and all.
[19/07/22, 20:28:49] Rohan: Ultimate is going to get featured in the edict🥳 I just did an interview with Ro AGS

[19/07/22, 21:21:27] Dhrthi Cool: Bro @918571977271 how was the 💩
[19/07/22, 21:39:37] Rishy: BTW this intense competitive drive in the older clubs is giving rise to a demand for a younger club with college grads where we can all play a more relevant role and build a team and grow together
[19/07/22, 21:40:18] Rishy: So there’s a meeting for that happening this weekend too. One of them approached me for it and I said I’m interested. Anyway I haven’t rostered with any club for the next season for the same reason
[19/07/22, 21:40:51] Rishy: So BITS/BPHC/Jain grads have started, and they wanted to know if Ashoka grads can also join

[20/07/22, 12:45:36] Dhruva Panyam: what
[20/07/22, 12:45:37] Dhrthi Cool: But also this is not something easily describable
[20/07/22, 12:45:37] Rishy: he doesn't give the main characteristic of single child energy
[20/07/22, 12:45:41] Rishy: but others I think

[20/07/22, 12:46:20] Dhruva Panyam: we've definitely had this conversation before and I am sticking with my hypothesis that it's fully biased based on what you know
[20/07/22, 12:46:20] Rohan: I've known each one of you independently since 2020. I've built relationship with each individual,  like for example you might have known everyone on this group but you didn't know parul since last sem, so your counter of knowing everyone starts last sem
[20/07/22, 12:46:37] Dhrthi Cool: OHHH
[20/07/22, 12:46:42] Dhrthi Cool: That's very interesting

[20/07/22, 12:47:59] Dhruva Panyam: yup
[20/07/22, 12:48:18] Kavya Satish: but i stand by it
[20/07/22, 12:49:01] Kavya Satish: guys who have been around more women in a household are VERY different from guys who have not
[20/07/22, 12:49:11] Dhruva Panyam: No one has ever said this to me lol
[20/07/22, 12:49:33] Kavya Satish: well that's changed now hasn't it
[20/07/22, 12:50:01] Uttara: I mean couldn't any of us ug22s say the same?

[20/07/22, 12:51:12] Dhrthi Cool: Like our relationship exists independent of everybody else
[20/07/22, 12:51:22] Kavya Satish: my biggest surprise was finding out nishant had a brother and not a sister
[20/07/22, 12:51:22] Dhrthi Cool: Maybe it's better dhruva
[20/07/22, 12:51:28] Dhrthi Cool: I get you fr
[20/07/22, 12:51:38] Kavya Satish: because dhruva ro and nishu have such similar vibes in that respect

[20/07/22, 13:07:31] Hari: instead of getting 0 he'll get 10
[20/07/22, 13:07:37] Hari: so he's advantaging
[20/07/22, 13:07:42] Rishy: but he's undertaking a risk

[21/07/22, 15:12:52] Rohan: They're following the zepto grocery delivery model
[21/07/22, 15:13:32] Rohan: Will be restaurants from Max 2km and food that's almost already made and just has to be packed
[21/07/22, 15:22:49] Hari: not quite
[21/07/22, 15:23:38] Hari: they have a bunch of restraunts who send specific reheat able dishes to them. The dishes will be frozen
[21/07/22, 15:23:46] Hari: when you order they'll heat and give
[21/07/22, 15:24:17] Rohan: Are those dishes good?
[21/07/22, 15:24:25] Hari: but the food doesn't come from the restaurant to you. It comes from a Zomato "outlet" that does the reheating, packing and all
[21/07/22, 15:24:28] Rohan: Is it comparable to like frozen pizza in the US
[21/07/22, 15:24:35] Hari: taste or variety?
[21/07/22, 15:24:38] Hari: but both good
[21/07/22, 15:25:13] Hari: today i had awadh biryani and it was good - obviously some tradeoff between taste and delivery time has to be there
[21/07/22, 15:25:17] Hari: but it was quite good
[21/07/22, 15:25:42] Hari: there is pizza also in this. haven't had it tho

[24/07/22, 21:24:13] Kavya Satish: For those who aren’t Ultiworld subscribers, we will usually have one Game of the Day that will be free for everyone. The Color of Ultimate Showcase Game will also be free. All these free games will also be streamed on our YouTube channel. In addition, the finals of all three divisions will be free and simulcast around the world on the Olympics Channel and WFDF website.
[24/07/22, 21:24:44] Nishant: Ok to watch WUCC live 13 dollars a month we need
[24/07/22, 21:32:36] Rishy: Can we do one month and log in multi device
[24/07/22, 21:32:43] Rishy: Will that website be smart enough
[25/07/22, 08:47:38] Nishant: Might be bro
[25/07/22, 08:47:59] Nishant: There's a separate college/ club team subscription for this kind of big group usecase
[25/07/22, 08:48:07] Nishant: So I'm assuming they'll have a way to figure
[25/07/22, 09:07:58] Rishy: And what’s that priced at
[25/07/22, 09:08:44] Nishant: No scene bro
[25/07/22, 09:08:50] Nishant: Some 395 dollars
[25/07/22, 09:09:01] Rishy: Oof
[25/07/22, 09:09:10] Rishy: YouTube has nothing for WMUCC?
[25/07/22, 09:09:11] Kavya Satish: bruh
[25/07/22, 09:10:02] Nishant: Only select games and the knockout games for wucc
[25/07/22, 09:10:05] Nishant: On YouTube
[25/07/22, 09:10:12] Rishy: Okay that’s still good
[25/07/22, 09:10:15] Nishant: Yeah
[25/07/22, 09:10:24] Rishy: We can otherwise buy for 1 month and use as much as possible
[25/07/22, 09:10:40] Rishy: This month, shall we?
[25/07/22, 09:11:11] Nishant: Maybe there'll be trial period. If multiple can't use we can reconsider if needed
[25/07/22, 09:11:13] Nishant: But in
[25/07/22, 09:12:14] Dhrthi Cool: Is that 13$
[25/07/22, 09:12:31] Rishy: Okay same. Can you initiate? 

And whoever among us want to use, we’ll split and worst case not use together
[25/07/22, 09:12:55] Nishant: I'll see in the evening after work
[25/07/22, 09:13:10] Nishant: Need US card to pay for this stuff no
[25/07/22, 09:13:14] Nishant: Will ask dad or bro

[25/07/22, 09:37:54] Rishy: https://ultiworld.com/2022/07/22/how-to-watch-the-2022-world-ultimate-club-championships/

see this and tell final decision, if we should buy or not?
[25/07/22, 09:54:56] Rishy: Bro, but if we find 40 people to split a club pack with, it'll come to 10 USD per person for one full year. Not per month. And that's also how they are advertising it. 

I've written an email to them to ask what's the limit on club team users, and how to add users – if can I just add email IDs or if they'll need some proof. 

If it's sounding chill, we can easily mobilise people.
[25/07/22, 12:04:09] Rishy: they replied, can do this

[25/07/22, 23:33:11] Rishy: This would come down to 500 per person – and includes all pro content plus lifetime access to the games of this calendar year
[25/07/22, 23:33:49] Rishy: Anyone interest to help me make this happen? Will take it ahead only then. 
Basically one google form to be circulated among India ultimate and payment collection and tracking.
[26/07/22, 09:51:42] Rishy: Team name is looking like Hold Court
[26/07/22, 09:51:46] Rishy: Thoughts?
[26/07/22, 09:52:03] Rishy: Abbreviation will be HC
[26/07/22, 09:52:05] Rishy: NLS HC
[26/07/22, 09:52:50] Kavya Satish: her campus
[26/07/22, 09:52:58] Rishy: Hehe
[26/07/22, 09:53:04] Kavya Satish: its cute
[26/07/22, 09:53:21] Kavya Satish: but i like motion to discmiss more 😳😳😳
[26/07/22, 09:53:46] Rishy: Can you imagine and compare the two on cheer potential
[26/07/22, 09:58:31] Kavya Satish: im seeing more look at that o line style cheers for the second 😎
[26/07/22, 09:59:02] Kavya Satish: motion is a great word
[26/07/22, 09:59:11] Kavya Satish: rhymes with so many other cool words
[26/07/22, 09:59:21] Kavya Satish: motion in the ocean
[26/07/22, 09:59:50] Kavya Satish: potion
[26/07/22, 09:59:52] Kavya Satish: commotion
[26/07/22, 10:00:04] Kavya Satish: explosion
[26/07/22, 10:09:20] Rishy: But what’s the cheer
[26/07/22, 10:09:54] Rishy: For eg, here someone can shout “It’s time to” and everyone can go “Hold Court” — 2 syllables
[26/07/22, 10:23:39] Rishy: Or sideline one person can say “Hold” and all others can shout “Court”  multiple times
[26/07/22, 10:23:47] Rishy: Like “Hammer” — “Heads”
[26/07/22, 10:29:47] Kavya Satish: motion to - discmiss
[26/07/22, 10:30:50] Rishy: 😂😂 cool
[26/07/22, 10:31:00] Rishy: Does no one get my concern
[26/07/22, 10:31:16] Rishy: Because I also like this name more. But I have cheer concerns
[26/07/22, 10:31:59] Kavya Satish: no because motion to discmiss still has so mucj potential

[26/07/22, 10:34:00] Kavya Satish: THERE'S MOTION IN THE OCEAN

[26/07/22, 10:38:17] Kavya Satish: I'll wait for my paraphernalia then
[26/07/22, 15:00:16] Dhruva Panyam: Unfortunately I'm on kavya's side here man
[26/07/22, 15:00:26] Dhruva Panyam: The cheer can be anything da
[26/07/22, 15:00:34] Dhruva Panyam: Why does the cheer need the team name in it?
[26/07/22, 15:00:51] Dhruva Panyam: You can shout Hold Court also as a cheer
[26/07/22, 15:00:56] Dhruva Panyam: If your team name is motion to
[26/07/22, 15:01:42] Hari: this needs some work wrt to rhyme scheme
[26/07/22, 15:01:46] Hari: something more symmetrical
[26/07/22, 15:02:01] Rishy: It's good man you don't have to take my side always
[26/07/22, 15:02:03] Dhruva Panyam: Time to pass the motion
[26/07/22, 15:03:15] Dhruva Panyam: There's motion in the ocean
Time to cause commotion
Hocus pocus potion
Time to pass the motion
[26/07/22, 15:03:25] Dhruva Panyam: But you get my point?
[26/07/22, 15:03:39] Rishy: Not fully
[26/07/22, 15:04:05] Rishy: The team name should be kinda shoutable no
[26/07/22, 15:04:19] Dhruva Panyam: In Hammerheads we only have Burn... as a cheer with the name in it
[26/07/22, 15:04:25] Dhruva Panyam: MTD
[26/07/22, 15:04:27] Rishy: (PS: MTD is too close to MTB and that was also a side contraint)
[26/07/22, 15:04:54] Rishy: But there's so much you can do with Hammer
[26/07/22, 15:05:00] Rishy: I'm not saying every cheer needs to have team name
[26/07/22, 15:05:00] Dhruva Panyam: Even if it's not (which it is), there's so much other potential
[26/07/22, 15:05:02] Dhruva Panyam: With motion to
[26/07/22, 15:05:07] Rishy: But team name should be cheer worthy
[26/07/22, 15:05:34] Rishy: this so much other potential is not tied to the name no, it's there irrespective?
[26/07/22, 15:05:56] Dhruva Panyam: Like you could have cheers from the sideline
Motion To? Defence
etc
[26/07/22, 15:06:08] Kavya Satish: this sounds like ur about to take a shit in the last line
[26/07/22, 15:06:22] Rishy: Which you can do even if MTx is not the name no
[26/07/22, 15:06:26] Rishy: Same argument
[26/07/22, 15:06:36] Hari: 😂😂😂
[26/07/22, 15:06:41] Nishant: +
[26/07/22, 15:06:42] Rishy: And the fact that so many other teams have punned on disc.
[26/07/22, 15:07:02] Kavya Satish: this is fun i v much like
[26/07/22, 15:07:09] Dhruva Panyam: I guess we'll agree to disagree then xD
[26/07/22, 15:07:35] Dhruva Panyam: You can always just shout law lingo as cheers
[26/07/22, 15:07:38] Rishy: I didn't see this coming here, but now that it's here I can see it
[26/07/22, 15:07:39] Dhruva Panyam: They'll work quite well
[26/07/22, 15:07:41] Rishy: Correct
[26/07/22, 15:07:45] Rishy: I also think
[26/07/22, 15:07:55] Dhruva Panyam: And so it's just between the team names xD
[26/07/22, 15:08:03] Kavya Satish: then just make the name whatever u like more no 😭
[26/07/22, 15:08:04] Dhruva Panyam: And I like Motion To X
[26/07/22, 15:08:13] Kavya Satish: that
[26/07/22, 15:08:14] Rishy: Are there any better exes
[26/07/22, 15:08:20] Dhruva Panyam: lol
[26/07/22, 15:08:42] Dhruva Panyam: Sorry man you'll have to manage with Lakshmi on the team
[26/07/22, 15:09:12] Dhruva Panyam: Motion To Hold Court
[26/07/22, 15:09:15] Rishy: I love Motion to Discmiss the most but it also has many factors taking away from it – overused disc in team names, MTB similarity
[26/07/22, 15:09:25] Dhruva Panyam: Yeah I'm also not a big fan of the discmiss
[26/07/22, 15:09:32] Dhruva Panyam: Which is why I haven't said it at all xD
[26/07/22, 15:09:37] Hari: it's like failed cutter
[26/07/22, 15:09:51] Hari: like why would u voluntarily say disc and miss together
[26/07/22, 15:09:54] Kavya Satish: then do motion to somethingggg
[26/07/22, 15:09:55] Rishy: Haha if only it would make sense
[26/07/22, 15:09:59] Dhruva Panyam: +
[26/07/22, 15:10:00] Rishy: Bro I didn't realise that
[26/07/22, 15:10:01] Rishy: Shit
[26/07/22, 15:10:03] Rishy: Okay that option is gone
[26/07/22, 15:10:08] Kavya Satish: BOOOOOOOOO
[26/07/22, 15:10:09] Rishy: Tell what
[26/07/22, 15:10:10] Hari: it's the opposite of what you're supposed to do
[26/07/22, 15:10:18] Rishy: Tell something
[26/07/22, 15:10:22] Kavya Satish: tell some more motions we'll try making puns
[26/07/22, 15:10:26] Rishy: The more we delay, the more the other faction is going to hold court
[26/07/22, 15:10:34] Rishy: google.com
[26/07/22, 15:10:37] Kavya Satish: this is all a conspiracy to rob me of my paraphernalia

[26/07/22, 20:04:38] Rishy: So you don't have a vote on NLS team name anymore
[26/07/22, 20:05:19] Kavya Satish: voting to deem rishy a buzzkill
[26/07/22, 20:05:24] Rohan: Can i join the core group as a consultant I'm a long-standing frisbee administrator and esteemed member of the National College committee
[26/07/22, 20:05:47] Rishy: You're also a competitor sir 😡

[01/08/22, 13:43:46] Kavya Satish: ASTON**
[01/08/22, 13:43:47] Kavya Satish: WTF
[01/08/22, 13:47:09] Rohan: The race reported it first
[01/08/22, 13:48:01] Rohan: Strange tho downgrade from fernando
[01/08/22, 13:48:28] Kavya Satish: insane
[01/08/22, 13:48:29] Kavya Satish: insane
[01/08/22, 13:48:31] Kavya Satish: insane
[01/08/22, 13:50:56] Rohan: It's funny tho Alo was replaced by Seb at Ferrari and now vice versa
[01/08/22, 13:52:18] Kavya Satish: big sigh
[01/08/22, 13:52:27] Kavya Satish: ferrari hype is gone bro
[01/08/22, 13:52:31] Kavya Satish: these are dark dark times
[01/08/22, 13:54:16] Rohan: Another bad move for fernando
[01/08/22, 13:55:09] Kavya Satish: apparently its because of otmar
[01/08/22, 14:00:19] Rohan: Alpine wouldn't have done that Aston would have wanted Fernando more and would have been willing to offer a more competitive deal because no one else was viable to replace seb with experience
[01/08/22, 14:03:19] Kavya Satish: hmm maybe
[01/08/22, 14:04:13] Rohan: That's a smart move
[01/08/22, 14:04:13] Rohan: Get greats with technical experience to develop the car
[01/08/22, 14:04:13] Rohan: Then Lance will get to fight for a title and a great driver by his side
[01/08/22, 14:05:17] Kavya Satish: no no i just like the otmar evicted alonso story more its so dramatic
[01/08/22, 14:16:00] Rishy: Woahh
[01/08/22, 14:19:41] Rohan: Alpine are fucked without Alonso
[01/08/22, 14:19:42] Rohan: Piastri is good but not Alonso level
[01/08/22, 14:19:42] Rohan: And ocon is ocon
[01/08/22, 14:28:54] Kavya Satish: the french fuck
[01/08/22, 14:37:08] Rohan: If Sargent does end up in the Williams I'd have called it before seb retired
[01/08/22, 14:37:36] Rohan: However i do think it's too soon
[01/08/22, 14:41:02] Kavya Satish: whos sargent

[01/08/22, 14:42:50] Rohan: Williams academy

[26/08/22, 19:03:52] Rishy: @919840299106 need one favour. 
When you’re free can you explain what these engine penalties are and why they start from back of the grid? I know you have limit on number of engines and all per year but so often so many people taking penalty? Why is it happening? What is it for? What’s failing for them?
[26/08/22, 19:04:31] Rishy: What plans for weekend then?
[26/08/22, 19:04:47] Nishant: Dude none
[26/08/22, 19:04:57] Rishy: -.-
[26/08/22, 19:05:32] Rishy: Maga today was one normal work weekday and we all put scenes. Weekend and all definitely happening. Come no! We can play frisbee, watch frisbee, play other games
[26/08/22, 19:07:54] Dhrthi Cool: Bro give me 12 hours
[26/08/22, 19:08:10] Dhrthi Cool: 90? Even then 90?
[26/08/22, 19:08:11] Dhrthi Cool: Nishu,
[26/08/22, 19:08:14] Dhrthi Cool: Up your game.
[26/08/22, 19:08:38] Dhrthi Cool: Last line, the dream
[26/08/22, 19:09:16] Rishy: Dude today I was at college and wasn’t even part of the scenes, but Dhruva Hari Parul played Catan and card games for half a day
[26/08/22, 19:09:19] Rishy: This is Bangalore
[26/08/22, 19:09:20] Rohan: For the longest time teams had access to 3 PUs for 18 race seasons, as number of races have increased the number of engines allowed hasn't so these days usually you see teams taking engine penalties, the punishment for an entire engine penalty is 30 places if you add individual components if I'm not wrong but 30 place isn't enforceable because regulations changed, saying can only be implemented over 1 race so instead of saying 30 place pen they automatically start at back. Ferrari are the only team that have taken numerous penalties already. What other teams are doing is they're taking penalties at circuits with variable weather and easy overtaking so the loss isn't that big. The reason for taking penalties now is to create a larger pool of penalties because after using an engine you can go back to a previous one without engine penalties, so if the season goes down to the wire it's better to extend the pool at beginning if you already know know there's chance you'll definitely need it, towards the end no trouble
[26/08/22, 19:09:34] Rohan: Ferrari is different case
[26/08/22, 19:09:42] Dhrthi Cool: Rohan big brain
[26/08/22, 19:09:52] Dhrthi Cool: Work???
[26/08/22, 19:10:39] Rohan: What theyve done is engine's are frozen till 2026 and are only allowed reliability modifications, so given how bad their engines were over last two years they said this year screw reliability they'll work on performance and look to improve on reliability by 23
[26/08/22, 19:10:44] Rishy: Superb man. You’re a legend. Got it 🙏🏻
[26/08/22, 19:10:47] Rohan: So that's why all their engines are so shit
[26/08/22, 19:11:30] Rishy: So performance of engines will be frozen at the end of this year? Until 2026?
[26/08/22, 19:11:50] Rohan: Was frozen in 2021
[26/08/22, 19:12:02] Rohan: So no significant upgrades allowed
[26/08/22, 19:12:14] Rishy: Then what is Ferrari working on this year at the expense of reliability?
[26/08/22, 19:12:14] Rohan: End 2021
[26/08/22, 19:12:23] Rishy: This?

[28/08/22, 16:06:08] Rohan: This reminds me of DD sport commentary
[28/08/22, 16:06:25] Rohan: But i think that's nature of our commentary
[28/08/22, 16:06:39] Dhrthi Cool: That guy in glasses in Gujarat played MTB

[28/08/22, 16:20:52] Nishant: Ya what was that stoppage about
[28/08/22, 16:20:53] Rohan: I mean there was a lot of contact
[28/08/22, 16:21:08] Rohan: But don't think it warranted spirit timeout
[28/08/22, 16:21:22] Rohan: Vardhan animated
[28/08/22, 16:21:30] Rohan: Box also
[28/08/22, 16:21:33] Nishant: Box full animated

[28/08/22, 16:22:40] Nishant: Spirit cap?
[28/08/22, 16:22:42] Nishant: Or no
[28/08/22, 16:23:13] Nishant: Great time to talk about one of our sponsors
[28/08/22, 16:23:26] Rohan: Nah
[28/08/22, 16:24:05] Rohan: Rutvik is SC of Gujarat
[28/08/22, 16:24:19] Nishant: I thought karan
[28/08/22, 16:24:25] Rohan: We really need communication to comm box about context
[28/08/22, 16:24:28] Rohan: He's captain
[28/08/22, 16:24:35] Nishant: Ohokk
[28/08/22, 16:24:44] Nishant: ++
[28/08/22, 16:26:32] Rohan: It's about contact is what I can gather from footage
[28/08/22, 16:26:55] Nishant: But this specifically i want to know
[28/08/22, 16:26:56] Dhrthi Cool: I also think so
[28/08/22, 16:38:59] Rohan: Too many calls
[28/08/22, 16:39:02] Rohan: I don't like

[28/08/22, 16:42:03] Rishy: Bro how was Rama that open
[28/08/22, 16:42:04] Nishant: Yes
[28/08/22, 16:42:11] Rishy: He’s always cheat code player
[28/08/22, 16:42:25] Rohan: TN have two of them
[28/08/22, 16:42:29] Rohan: It's too bad
[28/08/22, 16:42:43] Rishy: Who else? Vimal?
[28/08/22, 16:43:01] Rohan: Vimal to a less extent but cheat code nevertheless
[28/08/22, 16:43:16] Rishy: Vimal (from limited viewing) seems like hard working really effective guy man. He could even be more useful. But Rama feels like cheat code.
[28/08/22, 16:43:30] Rishy: Out of no where he’ll switch in turbo or something
[28/08/22, 16:44:56] Dhrthi Cool: Jagan less seen this match no

[28/08/22, 16:53:25] Rishy: Correct correct
[28/08/22, 16:53:30] Nishant: Blasting deep and so clinical
[28/08/22, 16:53:36] Rishy: Only thing is, he looks strong and built so not so much cheat
[28/08/22, 16:53:37] Nishant: And with throwers like Karan

[28/08/22, 16:59:53] Rishy: I thought Karan was just running into Manipa
[28/08/22, 16:59:59] Rishy: And Manipa has constantly had positioning
[28/08/22, 17:00:07] Rishy: But Manipa is like wtf man if you run into me I'm gonna do this

[29/08/22, 10:39:44] Rishy: @919840299106 does the pit lane start necessarily mean they'll end up last only when they rejoin the grid? Because of speed limit and all?
[29/08/22, 10:50:35] Kavya Satish: afaik yeah
[29/08/22, 10:51:25] Rishy: I want to see a video of a pit lane start rejoining the grid.. how can I find it

[29/08/22, 10:51:39] Kavya Satish: youtube pit lane start no
[29/08/22, 14:36:05] Rohan: So speed limit not an issue because they start at the end but they'll rejoin last because they can only start when the last driver on the grid crosses the first corner
[29/08/22, 14:36:42] Rohan: Watch Hungary no where lewis was the only one from the grid thay you'll be able to see exactly when others were allowed to leave

[16/10/22, 12:49:31] Rishy: Hi All, 

The AUDL is running an All Star event at the end of October and a voting contest is happening. Most voted for players (top 4 across 4 categories) will play! 

A desi star, Suraj Madiraju, is one of the candidates and it'd be great to support his campaign! He's quite the beast on field (https://youtu.be/RqGKOLP7oOY) and I've seen him play last season, certainly deserves a spot in the all star game. Pls go ahead and place a vote for him! 

Vote here:

[16/01/23, 20:04:44] Kavya Satish: oooo im so excited to read this

[17/01/23, 16:13:37] Rishy: ++

[17/01/23, 16:18:38] Uttara: Something about hammerheads not performing so why would they send types
[17/01/23, 16:23:26] Rishy: Interesting
[17/01/23, 16:23:34] Rohan: Nono as long as we're granted accomodation we'll be allowed to go
[17/01/23, 16:23:35] Rishy: If you don't send, how will they improve and perform
[17/01/23, 16:23:40] Rohan: Not performance based at all
[17/01/23, 16:23:52] Rishy: Thank God they're still sensible
[17/01/23, 16:24:00] Uttara: Idk man that's what Rushil said
[17/01/23, 16:24:01] Rohan: They're fucking stupid

[17/01/23, 16:24:32] Uttara: What's that

[17/01/23, 16:24:42] Rishy: lovely
[17/01/23, 16:47:22] Rohan: Essentially ncuc was always happening but they didn't have another tournament on the calendar for us this sem so we asked if we could flame
[17/01/23, 16:47:40] Rohan: They said yes last minute they said you can't stay of campus there so they cancelled
[17/01/23, 16:47:59] Rohan: So they're looking at other tournaments to send us for this sem in addition to ncuc
[18/01/23, 11:54:00] Rishy: I've booked for Nationals @ Surat.. anyone else as of now?
[18/01/23, 11:54:35] Kavya Satish: might come to watch, if i don't go to kochi
[18/01/23, 11:56:12] Rishy: Play with stray dogs or something
[18/01/23, 11:56:36] Kavya Satish: i think some team needed women, not SDIS tho
[18/01/23, 11:56:49] Rishy: Women can never get to not play, if they want
[18/01/23, 11:56:54] Rishy: Till today I haven't heard of one case
[18/01/23, 11:56:57] Rishy: Everyone wants women
[18/01/23, 11:56:58] Kavya Satish: lmao
[18/01/23, 11:57:09] Kavya Satish: im too scared to play club

[18/01/23, 11:57:56] Rishy: Kinda valid only, but only kinda 

If you go with the right mindset, it won't be an issue
[18/01/23, 11:58:11] Kavya Satish: i havent even had a tourney score yet
[18/01/23, 11:59:23] Rishy: Wrong mindset

[18/01/23, 12:17:32] Rishy: She hasn't scored in a tournament yet
[18/01/23, 12:17:32] Kavya Satish: not at all, stamina always fucks me over
[18/01/23, 12:18:37] Rishy: Which really doesn't say much
[18/01/23, 12:19:31] Kavya Satish: it says my cuts dont result in conversions
[18/01/23, 12:19:50] Dhruva Panyam: Wrong mindset
[18/01/23, 12:29:48] Kavya Satish: what is the correct then mf
[18/01/23, 12:30:30] Dhruva Panyam: Most cuts don't lead to conversions
Some cuts you make without the intention of conversion only
[18/01/23, 12:30:39] Dhruva Panyam: And you're an in-cutter no
[18/01/23, 12:31:14] Rohan: Agree with this
[18/01/23, 12:31:17] Rohan: And this
[18/01/23, 12:31:51] Dhruva Panyam: Start sending it deep bro you'll score
[18/01/23, 12:39:11] Rishy: Yes, just that more stamina is needed for deep cutter. You should be ready to sprint and get faked or get misthrown, so you’ll have to cut all over again and keep doing it
[18/01/23, 12:42:12] Dhrthi Cool: And this i feel like you could work towards this sem easily
[18/01/23, 12:42:38] Rishy: Agreed

[18/01/23, 13:14:55] Rohan: Actually not fully, we'll be around seed 9 you'll be last seed possibly and last year the way we did seeding for ncuc 9 and last was same pool
[18/01/23, 13:15:20] Rishy: Haha okay fun, let's see

[19/01/23, 18:44:34] Rishy: UPAI really needs to introspect
[19/01/23, 18:46:48] Uttara: About?
[19/01/23, 18:47:20] Rohan: U24 Tournament team also got dissolved
[19/01/23, 18:47:37] Nishant: Whoa

[19/01/23, 18:48:21] Rohan: All self funded
[19/01/23, 18:48:26] Rishy: This one’s on the players though. It was told that it’s a self-funded campaign. They were even given the figures.
[19/01/23, 18:48:27] Nishant: Yeah correct
[19/01/23, 18:48:32] Rishy: They just wasted everyone’s time & signed up
[19/01/23, 18:48:39] Uttara: Yeah I don't see spinergy either
[19/01/23, 18:48:40] Rishy: At least those who could afford could have gone
[19/01/23, 18:48:55] Uttara: That's strange they haven't missed a nationals in ever
[19/01/23, 18:49:16] Uttara: And they're not usually the last minute vibes
[19/01/23, 18:49:50] Uttara: I wonder when ultimate will become govt funded 🙏🏼
[19/01/23, 18:50:01] Rishy: Indian Club Ultimate is really really weird rn. So many teams not there. Female players have just disappeared
[19/01/23, 18:50:08] Uttara: :((
[19/01/23, 18:50:19] Uttara: How are the Mumbai teams do u know?

Ashokans, your task is to get the name to stick naturally

[31/01/23, 15:32:21] Rishy: *Centuries ago she came to be known as Case
[31/01/23, 15:33:26] Uttara: what does case mean
[31/01/23, 15:33:32] Uttara: like mental case?
[31/01/23, 15:33:51] Rishy: No one knows
[31/01/23, 15:33:57] Dhruva Panyam: It's a mystery

[31/01/23, 15:35:50] Rishy: If Kavya comes to be known as “case” on field and at Ashoka, by the time I see you all at NCUC, I’m going to treat @919840299106 @918940519162 @919444341510 to a big dessert

[31/01/23, 16:08:45] Uttara: fomo is happening since yesterday
[31/01/23, 16:09:07] Rishy: Your best strategy now, given what Rohan has done, is to resist it
[31/01/23, 16:09:17] Rishy: The more you resist, the more attractive for others to make it stick
[31/01/23, 16:09:26] Kavya Satish: i give up

[31/01/23, 18:38:08] Rishy: This is a placeholder
[31/01/23, 18:38:17] Rishy: Like Daogasar or something

[06/02/23, 18:25:03] Rohan: Don't tell anyone outside here but I'm so proud of our captains, the department wasnt gonna send us for any tournament apart from iit b and ncuc. But i recomended they talk to the dean and coaches them through the conversation that didn't go well, but after that they went and convinced the department to send us one soon
[06/02/23, 18:25:17] Kavya Satish: LFGGGGGG
[06/02/23, 18:25:18] Kavya Satish: OMG

[06/02/23, 18:25:41] Kavya Satish: yes ok my lips are sealed
[06/02/23, 18:25:50] Rohan: It also took a bit of me threatening the department by saying I'll quit the team
[06/02/23, 18:26:06] Rohan: But in respectful way
[06/02/23, 18:26:33] Kavya Satish: so we will do iitb, pdpu and something more also?

[24/02/23, 11:05:01] Uttara: This team is so chill
[24/02/23, 11:05:07] Uttara: They don't know what stress is
[24/02/23, 11:05:20] Nishant: Sexiest team
[24/02/23, 11:06:08] Hari: any personal highlights first match?
[24/02/23, 11:06:20] Uttara: I was their puller

[24/02/23, 11:07:02] Dhrthi Cool: hotttttt
[24/02/23, 11:07:26] Dhrthi Cool: why
[24/02/23, 11:07:51] Hari: got swalpa destroyed after coming back from auroville
[24/02/23, 11:07:52] Uttara: Honestly I came here to chill and watch some great ultimate
[24/02/23, 11:07:56] Hari: fever vibes
[24/02/23, 11:08:04] Uttara: And it's cool to do it as a part of flywild but I love just watching them
[24/02/23, 11:08:18] Dhrthi Cool: where can I see who is in the team
[24/02/23, 11:08:39] Hari: score against l2f?
[24/02/23, 11:08:48] Hari: also are y'all done for the day then?
[24/02/23, 11:09:11] Hari: unlikely
[24/02/23, 11:10:51] Nishant: 15-10 it seems
[24/02/23, 11:14:21] Hari: hmm
[24/02/23, 11:16:10] Dhruva Panyam: One reseeding match
[24/02/23, 11:17:22] Hari: ohh 10 points against flywild is good achieve imo
[24/02/23, 11:17:34] Hari: personal W
[24/02/23, 11:23:07] Uttara: They were playing 40 percent capacity conservating energy af
[24/02/23, 11:23:16] Uttara: Got called out for it in spirit circle xD
[24/02/23, 11:27:51] Dhrthi Cool: who v who is this
[24/02/23, 11:28:01] Dhrthi Cool: but why is it an issue
[24/02/23, 11:28:25] Dhrthi Cool: btw who all are in surat rn amongst all of u
[24/02/23, 11:28:44] Hari: rishy, uttara
[24/02/23, 11:29:08] Hari: wait wait what? wdym 40% capacity?
[24/02/23, 11:29:43] Dhrthi Cool: like not giving it their all I assume
[24/02/23, 11:33:39] Uttara: Yeah we were just playing what needed to be played. And I think rishy felt that was fair as we were giving what was required of us to win
[24/02/23, 11:33:45] Uttara: But not trying to get lots of point gap or anything
[24/02/23, 11:35:13] Rohan: Also in a tournament like this you need to slowly increase and first day do what needs to be done but not overdo it
[24/02/23, 11:35:28] Rohan: Otherwise by the time you reach finals you're fucked
[24/02/23, 11:36:04] Dhrthi Cool: yeah I don't understand how its bad spirit
[24/02/23, 11:36:18] Dhrthi Cool: so this is flywild v. l2f?
[24/02/23, 12:01:33] Uttara: Yes
[24/02/23, 12:04:20] Rohan: GK are in an interesting predicament if they finish 2nd in their group which they will, irrespective of how re-seeding goes they face either ambush or airborne assuming ambush beats L2f
[24/02/23, 12:04:58] Rohan: @918571977271
[24/02/23, 12:08:19] Rohan: Tomorrow morning could also be fun with L2f GK
[24/02/23, 12:09:17] Rohan: And winner airborne ambush
[24/02/23, 12:12:49] Uttara: Alex doing his signature one to one
[24/02/23, 12:12:51] Uttara: Bful
[24/02/23, 12:13:20] Uttara: I am manifesting rematch with Ambush in finals
[24/02/23, 12:32:51] Uttara: Flying spirits beat stall 7 on universe
[24/02/23, 12:33:30] Rohan: Flying spirits are a good team
[24/02/23, 12:33:37] Rohan: They have sushant/sushma tapse
[24/02/23, 12:33:41] Rohan: And few others
[24/02/23, 12:33:49] Rohan: All india u24 ganf
[24/02/23, 12:33:51] Rohan: Gang
[24/02/23, 12:34:50] Kavya Satish: woahhh
[24/02/23, 12:39:43] Hari: two foreign players also I think
[24/02/23, 12:45:36] Uttara: But the stall 7 squad v gg
[24/02/23, 12:45:51] Hari: it's vvv g yes
[24/02/23, 12:45:54] Uttara: Aravind said they had a bad game also
[24/02/23, 12:46:35] Hari: shantan, madhan, aravind in the guys and thara, ash, nitya in the women
[24/02/23, 12:48:15] Uttara: Av peeps represent
[24/02/23, 12:48:43] Hari: those twins are too psych man
[24/02/23, 12:48:59] Hari: I think they switched teams in day 2 of AV hat and no one knows
[24/02/23, 12:49:35] Nishant: 😂😂 are you serious
[24/02/23, 12:49:49] Nishant: Cool fellows
[24/02/23, 12:50:21] Kavya Satish: omg twins playing ultimate feels so cool for some reason
[24/02/23, 12:51:48] Kavya Satish: maybe i should convince adi to start playing
[24/02/23, 12:56:22] Hari: I have my doubts
[24/02/23, 13:07:32] Uttara: Manuela and Valeria Cardenas fr
[24/02/23, 13:08:09] Uttara: Bro I have known them since they were in diapers and I can't get over the fact that their parents names then shanthan madhan
[24/02/23, 13:11:46] Nishant: It’s nice names bro
[24/02/23, 13:14:44] Uttara: No I know it's just to twinny
[24/02/23, 13:14:45] Uttara: Yk
[24/02/23, 13:16:16] Hari: peace and handsome
[24/02/23, 13:24:47] Dhruva Panyam: How's l2f game looking?
[24/02/23, 13:26:32] Uttara: Ambush l2f?
[24/02/23, 13:26:36] Uttara: Rn 10-5
[24/02/23, 14:19:35] Kavya Satish: ambush win?
[24/02/23, 14:30:32] Hari: I still can't believe this man. Real gg to airb
[24/02/23, 14:37:24] Rishy: This game I watched full! Too too good!!
[24/02/23, 14:37:44] Hari: fuckkkk
[24/02/23, 14:37:51] Hari: did u record anything by any chance
[24/02/23, 14:37:57] Rishy: Damn good quality dude
[24/02/23, 14:38:20] Hari: why tf wouldn't they stream today man 😭
[24/02/23, 14:38:26] Hari: @919945885330
[24/02/23, 14:39:32] Rishy: No dude they were quite good.. one person will make an unforced error out of the 7 (outside of the top guys) 
Airbenders had a system and capitalised af. They’re doing lean squad scenes
[24/02/23, 14:39:33] Uttara: Yeah just epic
[24/02/23, 14:40:01] Kavya Satish: insaaaaane
[24/02/23, 14:40:08] Dhruva Panyam: @919945885330
[24/02/23, 14:40:15] Dhruva Panyam: You're done for the day no Rishy
[24/02/23, 14:40:40] Dhruva Panyam: Do finsta live
[24/02/23, 14:40:45] Rishy: +++ 
Good news is no Tamil around 
Even Tamil brothers are suppressed and not polluting with Tamil, they’re keeping it to themselves 
They know gujju’s and marathis are dominating here
[24/02/23, 14:41:17] Hari: "polluting" wtf bitch
[24/02/23, 14:42:03] Hari: dhruva this was quite a dumb statement man
[24/02/23, 14:42:20] Dhruva Panyam: Why bro
[24/02/23, 14:42:27] Dhruva Panyam: Regionals means everyone tamil
[24/02/23, 14:42:38] Hari: bro flywild is going to talk in tamil no matter what tournament
[24/02/23, 14:43:02] Rishy: Weak flo
[24/02/23, 14:43:19] Dhruva Panyam: What does that make me
[24/02/23, 14:43:37] Dhruva Panyam: I thought you wanted to hear Tamil all around you
[24/02/23, 14:43:41] Rishy: ++ 
Wasn’t an issue for me, they’ll only play as hard as you make them play and challenge them
[24/02/23, 14:43:45] Dhruva Panyam: Your paradise
[24/02/23, 14:43:57] Rishy: Correct
[24/02/23, 14:44:29] Hari: I wanted to hear that shouting from FW for those tight ass points that's all
[24/02/23, 14:44:44] Rishy: If it happens, ambush will win :P
[24/02/23, 14:44:55] Hari: interesting take
[24/02/23, 14:45:11] Dhruva Panyam: Wait bro he's replying in order
[24/02/23, 14:45:13] Dhruva Panyam: Don't rush
[24/02/23, 14:45:19] Hari: correct xD
[24/02/23, 14:45:23] Hari: 😂😭
[24/02/23, 14:45:46] Rishy: Airbenders showed composure af dude
[24/02/23, 14:46:10] Rishy: But also they can’t last the same way into day 3, clearly. 
I call they’ll lose the close match ups as the tournament progress.
[24/02/23, 14:46:11] Hari: did you record some stuff from that game 🤌🏾🙏🏾😭🤌🏾🙏🏾
[24/02/23, 14:46:23] Rishy: No man didn’t have phone on me
[24/02/23, 14:46:26] Rishy: Was enjoying watching
[24/02/23, 14:46:34] Rishy: ++
[24/02/23, 14:46:43] Rishy: I’m done
[24/02/23, 14:46:58] Dhruva Panyam: This is the problem
[24/02/23, 14:47:05] Dhruva Panyam: I was waiting for replies
[24/02/23, 14:47:14] Rishy: Tell me which
[24/02/23, 14:47:29] Dhruva Panyam: .
[24/02/23, 14:47:39] Dhruva Panyam: .
[24/02/23, 14:48:03] Hari: .
[24/02/23, 14:48:14] Dhruva Panyam: Yeah those 3 msgs
[24/02/23, 14:48:21] Dhruva Panyam: C'mon man rishy
[24/02/23, 14:49:00] Dhruva Panyam: You can practise your scenes
[24/02/23, 14:51:08] Rishy: Yes
[24/02/23, 14:51:49] Rishy: I agree dude. Just cost I’m guessing. And they knew there would be some non-tight games. So maybe no ROI.
[24/02/23, 14:52:06] Rishy: Even in international tournaments, WFDF and all, only good games get streamed, not all
[24/02/23, 14:52:15] Hari: what R are they expecting anyway man?
[24/02/23, 14:52:22] Rishy: So tomorrow & day after — you’ll definitely see the closest games of all teams live
[24/02/23, 14:52:26] Rishy: That’s how it’s planned
[24/02/23, 14:52:32] Dhruva Panyam: Bro tmrw they're streaming some 22v24 instead of 1v3 and 2v4
[24/02/23, 14:52:43] Hari: WHAT
[24/02/23, 14:52:48] Dhruva Panyam: Not semis
[24/02/23, 14:52:53] Dhruva Panyam: But still
[24/02/23, 14:53:07] Rishy: That’s why
[24/02/23, 14:53:27] Rishy: It’s the closest game for those teams that’ll get streamed man
[24/02/23, 14:53:29] Rishy: Equality
[24/02/23, 14:53:34] Rishy: Everyone’s paid equally for it
[24/02/23, 14:54:14] Hari: the cost for streaming was included in tournament fee?
[24/02/23, 14:54:18] Hari: how much was it?
[24/02/23, 14:54:30] Rishy: Breakup we don’t have. But yes ofc.
[24/02/23, 14:54:42] Dhruva Panyam: Okay more importantly
[24/02/23, 14:54:47] Dhruva Panyam: .
[24/02/23, 14:56:02] Rishy: Nah I wanna watch man. It’s too interesting. Discussing and breaking down every single thing talking on the sideline and all
[24/02/23, 14:56:13] Rishy: Also I don’t think you’ll enjoy
[24/02/23, 14:56:19] Rishy: You watch on live stream
[24/02/23, 14:56:21] Dhruva Panyam: Ya fine
[24/02/23, 14:56:21] Rishy: I’ll do commentary
[24/02/23, 14:56:28] Dhruva Panyam: Send updates then
[24/02/23, 14:56:37] Rishy: I’ll send link for this
[24/02/23, 14:56:45] Dhruva Panyam: Or take some vid of 1 point at least
[24/02/23, 14:56:52] Rishy: UJ did no
[24/02/23, 14:56:59] Dhruva Panyam: Ya you also do
[24/02/23, 14:58:36] Dhruva Panyam: Ok cut
[24/02/23, 14:58:38] Dhruva Panyam: You enjoy
[24/02/23, 14:58:48] Dhruva Panyam: Will await tmrw and your voice
[24/02/23, 14:59:34] Hari: but one sec what's this 22v24 and not top games
[24/02/23, 14:59:40] Rishy: I’m dftd I’ve left the ground
[24/02/23, 14:59:58] Hari: 22v24 will be one of the games no? there will be other good games?
[24/02/23, 15:00:14] Hari: also send link to schedule. Where are u seeing streaming?
[24/02/23, 15:00:39] Dhruva Panyam: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1utwkPu_SdTh5GKT6noQXUDEkl4Vpx09ljntnJI_2gio/edit
[24/02/23, 15:03:30] Rishy: Commentary schedule will be out by EOD too. So that it’s even across people and no too much workload on some.

[24/02/23, 17:02:23] Uttara: That's rude
[24/02/23, 17:03:45] Rohan: I think it'll be reverse of what happened last nationals if ambush Flywild finals
[24/02/23, 17:04:19] Rohan: Last time Flywild were favourites against Awadh and lost to them in Pool Play but beat them in finals
[24/02/23, 17:05:44] Rishy: I think it’ll be Airborne vs Ambush finals though :P
[24/02/23, 17:06:09] Rohan: Agree
[24/02/23, 17:06:20] Rohan: Think airborne are genuinely too strong with rocket back
[24/02/23, 17:06:33] Rohan: They've actually got a balanced team
[24/02/23, 17:06:57] Rohan: Ooo Flywild vs Flying spirits was 15-11?
[24/02/23, 17:08:25] Rishy: Only thing is Ambush doesn’t have Ritwik
[24/02/23, 17:09:23] Rohan: F
[24/02/23, 17:09:26] Rohan: Why don't they?

[24/02/23, 17:45:55] Rishy: Ambush 14-8 Airborne in the 7v1 seed swap game. So ambush now seed 1.
[24/02/23, 17:48:20] Rohan: F

[25/02/23, 12:30:35] Kavya Satish: rishy score!!!
[25/02/23, 12:30:36] Rohan: Vanjuuu
[25/02/23, 12:30:43] Nishant: Woohooo
[25/02/23, 12:31:42] Dhruva Panyam: Let's goo
[25/02/23, 12:31:52] Dhruva Panyam: Rohan why are you an advocate of starting on D?
[25/02/23, 12:32:12] Kavya Satish: we won pdeu because we started on D
[25/02/23, 12:32:44] Dhruva Panyam: That's lil extreme
[25/02/23, 12:32:57] Dhruva Panyam: I want basic answer
[25/02/23, 12:33:15] Rohan: Because if you get that one break in the first half it gives you the chance for a second by starting on O for second break
[25/02/23, 12:33:27] Kavya Satish: we got a score on D in first half and then just had to keep scoring on O
[25/02/23, 12:33:34] Rohan: Lax agreed with me here
[25/02/23, 12:33:59] Rohan: Nah we actually did, we got break on D then got o first point second half and that gave us extra break
[25/02/23, 12:34:01] Rohan: And 2 wins
[25/02/23, 12:34:07] Dhruva Panyam: But theoretically if you're able to hold all your O points, starting on O is the best right?
[25/02/23, 12:34:52] Kavya Satish: shid ur right
[25/02/23, 12:35:06] Rohan: Theoretically agree but practically it's bit different imo
[25/02/23, 12:35:09] Kavya Satish: rogi did we not hold all our O points
[25/02/23, 12:35:13] Kavya Satish: oh no wait we did
[25/02/23, 12:35:18] Rohan: Especially as o team
[25/02/23, 12:35:24] Rohan: We dropped towards end
[25/02/23, 12:35:25] Kavya Satish: we had 3 points on them
[25/02/23, 12:35:26] Rohan: 2 points
[25/02/23, 12:35:32] Rohan: College
[25/02/23, 12:35:37] Dhruva Panyam: If you start on D you will definitely need a break at some point
[25/02/23, 12:35:46] Dhruva Panyam: All this is theoretical btw
[25/02/23, 12:35:53] Rohan: I think as college team as game goes on silly mistakes creep in and the break is important
[25/02/23, 12:35:59] Rohan: Nono theoretical i fully agree
[25/02/23, 12:36:02] Dhruva Panyam: I don't think holding all O points is practical
[25/02/23, 12:36:24] Rohan: In practice I think it's bit different unless you're so clear of the other team
[25/02/23, 12:36:34] Dhruva Panyam: Ya cool
[25/02/23, 12:36:44] Dhruva Panyam: It's just that you've always been the strongest advocate xD
[25/02/23, 12:36:50] Dhruva Panyam: So wanted to clarify
[25/02/23, 12:37:23] Kavya Satish: may i offer my rookie opinion
[25/02/23, 12:37:30] Dhruva Panyam: May you
[25/02/23, 12:37:35] Kavya Satish: (based on 1 data point)
[25/02/23, 12:38:20] Nishant: Pah
[25/02/23, 12:38:29] Dhruva Panyam: Too goos
[25/02/23, 12:38:32] Kavya Satish: woahhhhh sorry distracted by that poiit
[25/02/23, 12:39:29] Kavya Satish: i think getting the break in the first half is easier, and O doesnt hold up at same level throughout the game
[25/02/23, 12:39:46] Rohan: That's for different reasons my reason for starting the first point on D is essentially i think first point of the game is when silly mistakes/chemistry issues comes
[25/02/23, 12:41:00] Kavya Satish: plus, personally, when i realised we would start on O after the half the pressure felt a lot less on D to get a break after the first one (i wasn't on D line but i assume that may have affected how game was played?)
‎[25/02/23, 12:41:04] Rohan:  ‎video omitted
[25/02/23, 12:41:30] Kavya Satish: omg so much is happening
[25/02/23, 12:41:33] Kavya Satish: so fastly
[25/02/23, 12:42:51] Dhruva Panyam: I guess so, but that works for the other team also
[25/02/23, 12:43:16] Kavya Satish: then this
[25/02/23, 12:44:03] Dhruva Panyam: Okay so basic point is that _if_ you get a break in the first half then the second half feels less pressured?
[25/02/23, 12:44:09] Dhruva Panyam: I agree with it
[25/02/23, 12:44:14] Kavya Satish: yes
[25/02/23, 12:44:15] Dhruva Panyam: I guess not as strongly though
[25/02/23, 12:46:54] Dhrthi Cool: Then in the half you'll lose and need to get break then
Easier to get a break in the beginning no rather when you're tired
[25/02/23, 12:48:32] Dhrthi Cool: I think so
[25/02/23, 12:52:39] Dhruva Panyam: But if you go down a break in the first half (because it's easy to get breaks in the first half) then you need 2 breaks in the second half (when it's harder)
[25/02/23, 13:02:22] Nishant: Rishyyy with the D
[25/02/23, 13:02:24] Nishant: Champ
