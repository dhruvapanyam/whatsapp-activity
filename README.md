# WhatsApp Chat Activity Animation

### Simulate activity over time

This is a small program that animates a WhatsApp chat's member activity over time. You can change a few settings to view the number/percentage of messages/words.

## How to use

1. Export the WhatsApp chat of your choice (Note that the maximum export is 40000 messages, so if you want to save more than that, you'll have to combine previous export.txt files)
2. Open ```index.html```.
3. Choose your exported chat .txt file on the page.
4. Select the "Play" checkbox to play/pause the animation
